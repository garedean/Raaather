I want to be able to vote for a choice by clicking on it.

I want my vote to cause the comments to show without page reload

Many rather
Each rather has two choices. Let’s make this a single table with columns
Each rather has many comments

Rather:
choice_one_text:text
choice_one_votes:integer
choice_two_text:text
choice_two_votes:integer
